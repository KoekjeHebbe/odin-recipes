We are doing good so far.
I really enjoy using the command line for everything. I haven't touched my file explorer once. Even when I accidentally cloned this repo into the directory of the previous assignment. I fixed it through commandline.
I am quickly figuring out the shortkeys in vsc for a more efficient workflow.
Anyways. This project will serve to showcase the html knowledge I have gathered so far by making a recipe website.
