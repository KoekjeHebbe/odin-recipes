        <h2>Surprise your family with this easy but delicious ribs recipe</h2>
            <p>These are the best ribs! Baking low and slow is our secret to fall off the bone oven-baked ribs. Some people think that ribs should be left to the “pit masters” — it’s just not true. Baking ribs in the oven is seriously easy. All you need is time — 95% of the recipe time is sitting back and relaxing while the ribs bake. Let’s do this!</p>
            <p>The best, most fool-proof way to make sure that your ribs are fall off the bone tender is to bake them, covered, at a low temperature in your oven. We bake our ribs in a 275° F oven for two to three hours. It is this simple method that guarantees tender ribs!</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1/4 cup finely diced onion</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>  
                <li>1/2 cup ketchup, try our homemade ketchup recipe</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon hot chili sauce (suggestion Sriracha)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>Salt and ground pepper, to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 275° Fahrenheit (135C).</li>
                <li>If the ribs still have the thin membrane covering the back of the rack, remove it. See how in the notes section below.</li>
                <li>Season both sides of the ribs with a generous amount of salt and pepper. If you are using a spice rub, add season the ribs with it now. Place the ribs, meat-side up, into a large roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet. (It may be necessary to cut the ribs in half for them to fit into the pan).</li>
                <li>Cover the pan or baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil, and then bake until the meat falls easily from the bones, 2 ½ to 3 ½ hours. We like to check the ribs after 2 hours to see how they are progressing. The ribs are done when the meat is cooked through and tender.</li>
